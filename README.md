SelectableTextView
==================

Android - My implementation of a selectable TextView for Android 2.3.3 and up.

This is NOT an EditText with selection enabled pretending to be a TextView.
I've implemented cursor controller on top of the TextView. (The source code of Android was a great help for me in making my own implementation.)

You should be able to build the source and run the example on your Android device without any modifications. 
Long click to start the text selection.
